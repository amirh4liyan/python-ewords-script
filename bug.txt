roots. We have f .0/ D 0, f .4/ D 2, f .10/  3:16228. Note that, although there are
two numbers whose square is 4, namely, �2 and 2, only one of these numbers, 2, is the
square root of 4. (Remember that a function assigns a unique value to each element in
its domain;p it cannot assign two different values to the same input.) The square root
function x always denotes p                         p root of x. The two solutions of
                                 the nonnegative square
the equation x 2 D 4 are x D 4 D 2 and x D � 4 D �2.

vals,

Most of the functions we encounter will have domains that are either intervals or unions
of intervals.

                                    The domain is the closed interval Œ�1; 1.
